      In 2013 I started at Syrinx Consulting as a Senior Software Engineer where I
      contracted with dozens of companies all over the US.
    </p>
    <p>
      We worked on everything from turning back–of–a–napkin sketches into shipping
      products all the way up to enterprise development and maintenance. I acted as a
      sales engineer, hands–on developer, team lead, and project manager.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2016 I was made an associate partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2022 we were acquired by DeWinter Group and began operating as Maris Consulting.
