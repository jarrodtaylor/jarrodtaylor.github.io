## Alternator v2.2 [](permalink)

[Alternator](https://alternator.sh) is my handy little tool for building websites.
It’s a native Swift CLI executable that runs on MacOS.

v2.2 is out now with a few parser bug fixes and a simplified macro syntax.

You might be surprised what all a static site can do when they’re easy to manage.
