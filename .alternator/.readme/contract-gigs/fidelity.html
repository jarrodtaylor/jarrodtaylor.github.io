      The Fidelity Bloom app uses psychology to help people improve their saving and
      spending habits.

      I worked on the design and implement of a scalable configuration system inside
      the app so we could customize features for universities and corporate sponsors,
      allowing them to create unique experiences for their students and employees.

      Using the Fidelity OnSite Hub iOS app, Fidelity employees can book desks and
      conference rooms to fit their hybrid work schedules, find out when and where
      their colleagues are stationed, and coordinate in-person working sessions with
      their teams. All driven by Microsoft Teams, Exchange, and Graph data.
