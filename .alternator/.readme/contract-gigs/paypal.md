Before NFC payments were a thing, PayPal was branching out into retail and
mobile payments by taking advantage of new smartphone capabilities.

I worked with them to develop iOS and Android SDKs for retailers. The SDKs
leveraged PayPal services to manage payments, users, locations, products, and
shopping sessions.

We used Bluetooth Low Energy to interface with cash registers for in-store
digital payments.
