The Fidelity Bloom app uses psychology to help people improve their saving and
spending habits.

I worked on the design and implement of a scalable configuration system inside
the app so we could customize features for universities and corporate sponsors,
allowing them to create unique experiences for their students and employees.

Using the Fidelity OnSite Hub iOS app, Fidelity employees can book desks and
conference rooms to fit their hybrid work schedules, find out when and where
their colleagues are stationed, and coordinate in-person working sessions with
their teams. All driven by Microsoft Teams, Exchange, and Graph data.

I helped get the initial version ready to ship.
