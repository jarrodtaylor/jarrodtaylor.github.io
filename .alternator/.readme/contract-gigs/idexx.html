      The IDEXX Preventative Care Challenge (PCC) tool allows veterinarians access to
      customized testing panels and protocols, pet owner communication tools, and
      personalized training.
    </p>
    <p>
      Initially released in US and Canada, IDEXX wanted to extend PCC to the
      Australian market, requiring unique test panels options, pricing and discount
      calculations, reporting and feedback methods, and SAP integration.
    </p>
    <p>
      We extended the language internationalization to include AU English, integrated
      with the Global SAP system to manage AU access, added AU specific test panels,
      replaced their outdated LavaStorm reporting tools with new custom tools,
      replaced the existing SES emailing integration with SendGrid, streamlined their
      iPad apps, helped audit and secure the PCC application code, and assisted with
      hiring and training new developers.
