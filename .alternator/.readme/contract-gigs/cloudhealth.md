CloudHealth provides cloud computing services related to cost management,
governance, automation, security, and performance.

I implemented their then-new design system, built various front end features for
tracking cloud server health, integrated third-party APIs and services, and
worked closely with backend developers to design and implement RESTful APIs for
seamless data exchange between the front- and backend systems.
