<!-- Nov 11 - Feb 13 -->

In 2011 I went back to freelancing, helping local businesses with web/mobile
design and development.

With BrightFire, I built a Rails engine to handle the backend of websites for
their client, QuintEvents.

Sites such as COTA Experiences, NFL Pro Bowl On Location, and Grand Prix
Experiences used the engine to manage block tickets sales.

With Career Training Concepts, I turned Dr. Gary Arthur’s study guide program
from a workbook into Counselor Exams, a practice exam web app with purchasable
study materials.
