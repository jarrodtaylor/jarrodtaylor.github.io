    <p>
      eKwipper was a mobile web app (before app stores) for creating grocery lists,
      locating products in stores, and consolidating digital coupons for quick
      scanning during checkout.
    </p>
    <p>As employee #5, this was my first startup experience.</p>
    <p>
      I built the consumer desktop and mobile web apps, designed the B2B UX for
      tracking inventory and product placement, and worked with the engineering team
      on integrating our backend system with grocery store cash registers.
