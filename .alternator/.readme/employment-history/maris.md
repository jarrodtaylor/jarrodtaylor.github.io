In 2013 I started at Syrinx Consulting as a Senior Software Engineer where I
contracted with dozens of companies all over the US.

We worked on everything from turning back–of–a–napkin sketches into shipping
products all the way up to enterprise development and maintenance. I acted as a
sales engineer, hands–on developer, team lead, and project manager.

In 2016 I was made an associate partner.

In 2022 we were acquired by DeWinter Group and began operating as Maris
Consulting.
