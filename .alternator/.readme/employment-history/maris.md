In 2013 I started at Syrinx Consulting as a Senior Software Engineer where I
contracted with dozens of companies all around the US. We worked on everything
from turning back–of–a–napkin sketches into shipping products all the way up to
enterprise development and maintenance.

In 2016 I was made an associate partner and, in addition to hands–on
development, began acting as a sales engineer, team lead, and project manager.

In 2022 we were acquired by DeWinter Group and began operating as Maris
Consulting.
