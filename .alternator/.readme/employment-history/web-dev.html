    <p>
      In 2011 I went back to freelancing, helping local businesses with web/mobile
      design and development.
    </p>
    <p>
      With BrightFire, I built a Rails engine to handle the backend of websites for
      their client, QuintEvents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sites such as COTA Experiences, NFL Pro Bowl On Location, and Grand Prix
      Experiences used the engine to manage block tickets sales.

    <p>
      With Career Training Concepts, I turned Dr. Gary Arthur’s study guide program
      from a workbook into Counselor Exams, a practice exam web app with purchasable
      study materials.
