Front Porch, a hotspot ISP and advertising platform, was the sole investor in
eKwipper. When eKwipper shut down, Front Porch brought me on as a R&D Engineer
for the company officers.

Their main product was a router for hotels that showed ads when visitors joined
the wifi network. The growth of 3G necessitated a new strategy.

My role was to collect new ideas and quickly turn them into prototypes,
bypassing the typically slow engineering timelines and red tape.
