This new audio drama from Joe Fisher and Finlay Stevenson about the adventures
of a time–traveling, dimension–spanning diner blends the best of old–timey radio
serials, classic sci–fi, and modern escapism.

> No one knows who built Midnight Burger or how it works, but when it appears
> there’s always someone around who could really use a cup of coffee. “When the
> waves of the universe crash unrelentingly, when the stars seem indifferent to
> your plight, suddenly there is a diner.” We open at 6.
