eKwipper was a mobile web app (before app stores) for creating grocery lists,
locating products in stores, and consolidating digital coupons for quick
scanning during checkout.

As employee #5, this was my first startup experience.

I built the consumer desktop and mobile web apps, designed the B2B UX for
tracking inventory and product placement, and worked with the engineering team
on integrating our backend system with grocery store cash registers.
