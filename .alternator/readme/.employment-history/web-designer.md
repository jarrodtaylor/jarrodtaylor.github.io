<!-- Dec 01 - Aug 09 -->

I got my start at 17 building a video studio in the back of a prepress shop.
It quickly led to creating interactive video CDs with Macromedia Director and
eventually to building websites. I handled the design, production, and
promotional materials for client projects, from concept to completion.
