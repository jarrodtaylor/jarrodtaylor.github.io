### [Midnight Burger](https://www.weopenatsix.com)

When Gloria took a waitressing job at a diner outside of Phoenix, she didn’t
realize she was now an employee of Midnight Burger, a time–traveling,
dimension–spanning diner. Every day Midnight Burger appears somewhere new in the
cosmos along with it’s staff: a galactic drifter, a rogue theoretical physicist,
a sentient old–timey radio, and some guy named Caspar. No one knows who built
Midnight Burger or how it works, but when it appears there’s always someone
around who could really use a cup of coffee.

> “When the waves of the universe crash unrelentingly, when the stars seem
> indifferent to your plight, suddenly there is a diner.”
