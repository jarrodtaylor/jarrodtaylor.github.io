## We Ship Software

<aside>You should hire us.</aside>

[We Ship Software][wss] is a tech agency I run with [Richard][richard].

We help growing businesses build and deliver better software than anything
available to their competitors.

Long term, we’ll be partnering with up-and-coming content creators to build,
ship, and maintain productized services tailored for their audiences.
