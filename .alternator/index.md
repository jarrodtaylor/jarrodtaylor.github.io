  I loved watching this. My takeaway: don’t just say what it does, explain how it does
  what it does.

My thanks to TextJam for sponsoring this past week at DF. TextJam just launched last
week, it’s a remarkable “1.0” release — a multi-player text editor / word processor
with a novel twist on how humans interact with AI. TextJam introduces the metaphors
of “pen” mode for writing in ink, when you know exactly what words you want to write,
with “pencil” mode for text you want to use a prompt or just a simple dashed-off
starting point for AI assistance. It sounds like it makes intuitive sense, and when
you actually try it, it feels even more natural. I really love this metaphor of ink
vs. pencil. It leaves you, the writer, in control, but also gives all the assistance
you want.
